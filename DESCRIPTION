Version: 1.0.0

Description: This package contains the "errantabun" function which produces an errant species abundance matrix. 
    This errant species abundance matrix is calculated from an original species abundance matrix and a randomized, 
    statistical distribution. Currently, the available statistical distributions are Poisson and binomial. This 
    function utilizes the "rpois" and the "rbinom" functions to create an abundance distribution for each species. 
    The lambda for the Poisson distribution is the original abundance (vector) for each species. The size for 
    the binomial distribution is the original abundance (vector) for each species. This package also contains a sample 
    abundance matrix collected from the Koffler Scientific Reserve at Joker's Hill (University of Toronto). Fourteen 
    blocks serve as disparate communities of grassland plant species. Each block contains an array of different-sized 
    plots: eight 0.5m^2, eight 1m^2, and four 2m^2 plots. Each column of this abundance matrix represents a grassland 
    plant species. Each row represents one of four 2m^2 plots from all 14 blocks.
