Title: Calculation of an Abundance Matrix using a Randomized Distribution
Version: 0.1.4
Authors@R: person("Jeonghoon", "Lee", email = "jeonghoon.lee@mail.utoronto.ca", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package contains the "errantabun" function which produces an errant abundance matrix.
    This errant abundance matrix is calculated from an original abundance matrix and a randomized, statistical distribution.
    This package also contains an abundance matrix collected from the Koffler Scientific Reserve: an assembly of grassland plant species.
    This version allows for the creation of an errant abundance matrix using either a random Poisson or a random binomial distribution.
