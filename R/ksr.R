#' Species abundance matrix from Koffler Scientific Reserve
#'
#' @description
#' This species abundance matrix is collected from the Koffler Scientific Reserve at Joker's Hill (University of Toronto).
#'
#' Fourteen blocks serve as disparate communities of grassland plant species. Each block contains an array of different-sized plots: eight 0.5m^2, eight 1m^2, and four 2m^2 plots.
#'
#' Each column of this abundance matrix represents a grassland plant species. Each row represents one of four 2m^2 plots from all 14 blocks.
